Please write a program which asks for the user's name. If the name is Huey, Dewey or Louie, the program should recognise the user as one of Donald Duck's nephews.

In a similar fashion, if the name is Morty or Ferdie, the program should recognise the user as one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.

Sample Outputs:

Please type in your name: Morty
I think you might be one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.

Please type in your name: Huey
I think you might be one of Donald Duck's nephews.
