Some say paying taxes makes Finns happy. According to the Finnish Tax Administration, when the gift is received from a close relative or a family member, the amount of tax to be paid is determined by the following table:

Value of gift         Tax at lower limit    Tax rate for exceeding part (%)
5 000 — 25 000        100                   8
25 000 — 55 000       1 700                 10
55 000 — 200 000      4 700                 12
200 000 — 1 000 000   22 100                15
1 000 000 —           142 100               17

So, for a gift of 6 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 180 euros (100 + (6 000 - 5 000) * 0.08).

Please write a program which calculates the correct amount of tax for a gift from a close relative. If the gift is valued at less than 5000 euros, there is no tax.

Sample Outputs:

Value of gift: 3500
No tax!

Value of gift: 5000
Amount of tax: 100.0 euros

Value of gift: 27500
Amount of tax: 1950.0 euros
