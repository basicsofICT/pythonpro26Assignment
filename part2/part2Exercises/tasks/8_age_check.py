Quick Start: Click Terminal > New Terminal | pwd (check location) | cd part2/part2Exercises/tasks (if needed)
Run: python 8_age_check.py | Check: python grade_part2.py

Please write a program which asks for the user's age. If the age is not plausible, that is, it is under 5 or something that can't be an actual human age, the program should print out a comment.

Sample Outputs:

What is your age? 13
Ok, you're 13 years old

What is your age? 2
I suspect you can't write quite yet...

What is your age? -4
That must be a mistake
