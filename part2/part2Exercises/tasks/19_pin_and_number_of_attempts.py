"""
Quick Start: Click Terminal > New Terminal | pwd (check location) | cd part2/part2Exercises/tasks (if needed)
Run: python 19_pin_and_number_of_attempts.py | Check: python grade_part2.py

Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

Sample Output:

PIN: 3245
Wrong
PIN: 1234
Wrong
PIN: 0000
Wrong
PIN: 4321
Correct! It took you 4 attempts

If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

PIN: 4321
Correct! It only took you one single attempt!
