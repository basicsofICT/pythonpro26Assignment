## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### 1: GitHub Codespaces 
**Steps to get started:**

1. **Accept the Assignment in Canvas** 
   - You will need a GitHub account. It is recommended to activate the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for additional benefits, though this is not required for completing the assignments.
   - Find the GitHub assignment link in Canvas and click it to accept the assignment. You can also find the repository in your GitHub account.
   - This creates your own copy of the repository with owner access. Teachers will also have access to your repository.
   - You will complete all tasks within this repository.

2. **Create a Codespace**
   - Navigate to your newly created repository in GitHub (the link is provided when you accept the assignment).
   - Click the green **"<> Code"** button
   - Select the **"Codespaces"** tab
   - Click **"Create codespace on main"**

3. **Start coding!**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for your environment to load
   - Your browser-based VS Code will open automatically
   - All Python tools and extensions are pre-installed
   - You can start working on the tasks immediately.

> **💡 Tip:** Once your codespace is created, you can resume work by simply opening the same codespace. You do not need to create a new one each time. If you don't use your codespace for approximately two consecutive weeks, you'll receive an email notification that it will be deleted. To prevent this, simply open and use your codespace periodically. If it does get deleted, you can create a new one without losing work, since you'll be regularly committing and pushing your code. However, we strongly recommend working on a regular basis to stay on track with the course. 

**Features:**
- ✅ Pre-configured Python 3.11
- ✅ All VS Code extensions installed
- ✅ Auto-save enabled
- ✅ Integrated terminal and debugger
- ✅ Works on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- ✅ Free 60 hours/month


### 2: Setting Up Your Local Development Environment & Working Locally 

> **💡 Note:** While you can complete all tasks using GitHub Codespaces in your browser, setting up a local development environment is **strongly recommended** for several reasons:
> - **Real-world experience**: Learn how professional developers set up and manage their tools
> - **Offline access**: Work without internet connectivity
> - **Better performance**: Native applications often run faster than browser-based environments
> - **Professional skills**: Understanding local setup is essential for future development work
> - **Long-term learning**: Build skills you'll use throughout your programming career
>
> Local development is not compulsory but provides valuable hands-on experience with industry-standard workflows. ***Starting from Part 2, it is strongly recommended to use the local development environment.***

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (for version control)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended editor)
- VS Code Python extensions

## 🎯 How to work on the tasks?

1. Navigate to each part's folder (e.g., `part1/`)
2. Complete the exercises in the task files
3. Run the grader: `python grade_partX.py` (from within the part folder)
4. Check your progress in `.progress/marksheet.md`

Each task is worth **1 point**. Your live progress is tracked automatically in `.progress/marksheet.md`.


### ✅ What You Should Edit:
- **All task files**: `1_emoticon.py`, `2_seven_brothers.py`, `11_extraspace.py`, etc.
- Work on the exercises and implement your solutions

### ❌ What You Should NOT Edit:
- **Grader files**: `grade_part1.py`, `grade_part2.py`, etc.
- **Main README**: This documentation file
- **Task specification files**: `p*Alltasks.md`, `part*alltasks.md`
- **Progress tracking**: `.progress/` folder contents

> **⚠️ Important:** Solutions are auto graded. Modifying them compromises learning and accurate self assessment. 

> **🚨 Warning:** Modifying grader files, the main README, or task specification files will trigger GitHub notifications to your teachers. Any unauthorized changes to these files may require you to reaccept the assignment and redo your tasks. Only edit the task solution files (e.g., `1_emoticon.py`, `2_seven_brothers.py`).
