## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### 1: GitHub Codespaces 
**Steps to get started:**

1. **Accept the Assignment in Canvas** 
   - You will need a GitHub account. It is recommended to activate the [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for additional benefits, though this is not required for completing the assignments.
   - Find the GitHub assignment link in Canvas and click it to accept the assignment. You can also find the repository in your GitHub account.
   - This creates your own copy of the repository with owner access. Teachers will also have access to your repository.
   - You will complete all tasks within this repository.

2. **Create a Codespace**
   - Navigate to your newly created repository in GitHub (the link is provided when you accept the assignment).
   - Click the green **"<> Code"** button
   - Select the **"Codespaces"** tab
   - Click **"Create codespace on main"**

3. **Start coding!**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for your environment to load
   - Your browser-based VS Code will open automatically
   - All Python tools and extensions are pre-installed
   - You can start working on the tasks immediately.

> **💡 Tip:** Once your codespace is created, you can resume work by simply opening the same codespace. You do not need to create a new one each time. If you don't use your codespace for approximately two consecutive weeks, you'll receive an email notification that it will be deleted. To prevent this, simply open and use your codespace periodically. If it does get deleted, you can create a new one without losing work, since you'll be regularly committing and pushing your code. However, we strongly recommend working on a regular basis to stay on track with the course. 

**Features:**
- ✅ Pre-configured Python 3.11
- ✅ All VS Code extensions installed
- ✅ Auto-save enabled
- ✅ Integrated terminal and debugger
- ✅ Works on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- ✅ Free 60 hours/month


### 2: Local Development (Part 2 onwards)
**For those who prefer working on their own computer**

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (for version control)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended editor)
- VS Code Python extensions

**📖 Complete Setup Guide:** **[→ LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md](LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

This comprehensive guide covers:

## 🎯 How to work on the tasks?

1. Navigate to each part's folder (e.g., `part1/part1Exercises/tasks/`)
2. Complete the exercises in the task files
3. Run the grader: `python grade_partX.py`
4. Check your progress in `.progress/marksheet.md`

Each task is worth **1 point**. Your live progress is tracked automatically in `.progress/marksheet.md`.

## 📚 For Students

### ✅ What You Should Edit:
- **All task files**: `1_emoticon.py`, `2_seven_brothers.py`, `1.1.1_extra_space.py`, etc.
- Work on the exercises and implement your solutions

### ❌ What You Should NOT Edit:
- **Grader files**: `grade_part1.py`, `grade_part2.py`, etc.
- **README files**: All documentation files
- **Task specification files**: `p*Alltasks.md`, `part*alltasks.md`
- **Progress tracking**: `.progress/` folder contents

> **⚠️ Important:** Solutions are auto-graded. Modifying them compromises learning and accurate self-assessment.

> **🚨 Warning:** Modifying grader files, README files, or task specification files will trigger GitHub notifications to your teachers. Any unauthorized changes to these files may require you to reaccept the assignment and redo your tasks. Only edit the task solution files (e.g., `1_emoticon.py`, `2_seven_brothers.py`) unless explicitly instructed otherwise by your instructor.
