Part 1.1 Getting Started: https://dipaish.github.io/programming-24/part-1/1-getting-started
Task 5: Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings. In addition to the double quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks '. This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:

Example: print('"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.')

Sample output:

"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.

Please write a program which prints out the following:

Sample output: 

print("Hello there!")
