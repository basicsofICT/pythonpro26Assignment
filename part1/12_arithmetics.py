Run: python 12_arithmetics.py | Check: python grade_part1.py

Programming exercise: Arithmetics

This program already contains two integer variables, x and y:

x = 27
y = 15

Please complete the program so that it also prints out the following:

Sample output:
27 + 15 = 42
27 - 15 = 12
27 * 15 = 405
27 / 15 = 1.8

The program should work correctly even if the values of the variables are changed. 
That is, if the first two lines are replaced with:

x = 4
y = 9

the program should print out the following:

Sample output:

4 + 9 = 13
4 - 9 = -5
4 * 9 = 36
4 / 9 = 0.4444444444444444

# TODO: Write your code below this line to print the arithmetic operations

x = 27
y = 15
