Programming exercise: Soup or No Soup

In a restaurant, the soup of the day costs €5.90. Please write a program which asks for the user's name and then asks for the number of portions of soup. If the name is "Jerry", the user doesn't get soup. If the name is anything else, the program calculates the total cost and prints it out.

Sample output:
Please tell me your name: Kramer
How many portions of soup? 2
The total cost is 11.8
Next please!
