Programming exercise: Food Expenditure

Please write a program which estimates a user's typical food expenditure.

The program asks the user how many times a week they eat at the student cafeteria, 
what the lunch costs, and how much money they spend on groceries in a week.

Based on this information, the program calculates the user's typical food costs both daily and weekly.

Sample output:
How many times a week do you eat at the student cafeteria? 4
The price of a typical student lunch? 2.50
How much money do you spend on groceries in a week? 28.5

Average food expenditure:
Daily: 5.5 euros
Weekly: 38.5 euros
