Programming exercise: Loyalty Bonus

This program calculates the loyalty bonus for a customer. 
If the customer has at least 50 points, they get a 10% bonus. Otherwise, they get a 5% bonus.

Please write a program which asks for the number of points on the customer's card. 
The program should then print out the bonus percentage and the new total points.

Sample output:
How many points are on your card? 55
Your bonus is 10 %
You now have 60.5 points

Note: Calculate new points as original_points + (original_points * bonus_percentage / 100)
