Programming exercise: Solving a Quadratic Equation

Please write a program which solves a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

The program should ask for the values of a, b, and c, and then print out the roots.

The roots can be calculated using the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Sample output:
Value of a: 1
Value of b: 2
Value of c: -8
The roots are 2.0 and -4.0

Hint: You can use the math.sqrt() function to calculate the square root. Import math at the top of your program.
Note: This exercise assumes the equation has real roots (b² - 4ac ≥ 0).
"""
# Hints:
# 1. Import the sqrt function from the math module
# 2. Ask for input values a, b, and c (use float for decimal numbers)
# 3. Calculate the discriminant: b² - 4ac
# 4. If discriminant is negative, print "The equation has no real roots"
# 5. Otherwise, calculate both roots using the quadratic formula:
#    root1 = (-b + √discriminant) / (2a)
#    root2 = (-b - √discriminant) / (2a)
# 6. Print the results: "The roots are X and Y"
