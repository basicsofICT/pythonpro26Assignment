Programming exercise: Solving a Quadratic Equation

Please write a program which solves a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

The program should ask for the values of a, b, and c, and then print out the roots.

The roots can be calculated using the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Sample output:
Value of a: 1
Value of b: 2
Value of c: -8
The roots are 2.0 and -4.0

Hint: You can use the math.sqrt() function to calculate the square root. Import math at the top of your program.
Note: This exercise assumes the equation has real roots (b² - 4ac ≥ 0).
