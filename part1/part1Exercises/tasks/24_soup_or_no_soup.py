Programming exercise: Soup or No Soup

In a restaurant, the soup of the day costs €5.90, but as a student you get a student discount of 30%.

Please write a program which asks for the user's name and then asks for the number of portions of soup. 
If the name is "Jerry", the user doesn't get soup. If the name is anything else, the program calculates 
the total cost and prints it out.

Sample output:
Please tell me your name: Kramer
How many portions of soup? 2
The total cost is 11.8
Next please!

Note: The student discount means each portion costs 5.90 * 0.70 = 4.13, but don't round in your calculations.
