Programming exercise: Daily Wages

Please write a program which asks for the user's hourly wage, hours worked, and day of the week. 
The program should then print out the user's daily wages.

On Sundays, the hourly wage is doubled.

Sample output:
Hourly wage: 8.5
Hours worked: 3
Day of the week: Monday
Daily wages: 25.5 euros

Note: Calculate wages as hourly_wage * hours_worked, and double it if the day is Sunday.
