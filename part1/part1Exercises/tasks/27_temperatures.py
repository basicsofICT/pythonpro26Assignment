Programming exercise: Temperatures

Please write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, 
and then prints out the temperature in degrees Celsius.

If the temperature is below zero degrees Celsius, the program should also print out "Brr! It's cold in here!".

The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9

Sample output:
Please type in a temperature (F): 21
21 degrees Fahrenheit equals -6.111111111111111 degrees Celsius
Brr! It's cold in here!

Note: Don't round the Celsius temperature.
