Programming exercise: What to Wear Tomorrow

Please write a program which asks for tomorrow's temperature and whether it will rain. 
Based on this information, the program should suggest what to wear.

The suggestion logic:
- If temperature is greater than or equal to 20 and it won't rain: "Wear jeans and a T-shirt"
- If temperature is greater than or equal to 10 and it won't rain: "Wear jeans and a T-shirt" + "I recommend a jumper as well"
- If temperature is less than 10 and it won't rain: "Wear jeans and a T-shirt" + "I recommend a jumper as well" + "Take a jacket with you"
- If it will rain: "Don't forget your umbrella!" (in addition to the above)

Sample output:
What is the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Temperature: 11
Will it rain (yes/no): no
Wear jeans and a T-shirt
I recommend a jumper as well

Note: Follow the exact order and conditions shown in the sample output.
