Programming exercise: What to Wear Tomorrow

Please write a program which asks for tomorrow's weather forecast and then suggests weather-appropriate clothing.

The suggestion should change if the temperature (measured in degrees Celsius) is over 20, 10 or 5 degrees, and also if there is rain on the radar.

Some examples of expected behaviour:


What is the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Temperature: 21
Will it rain (yes/no): no
Wear jeans and a T-shirt

What is the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Temperature: 11
Will it rain (yes/no): no
Wear jeans and a T-shirt
I recommend a jumper as well
