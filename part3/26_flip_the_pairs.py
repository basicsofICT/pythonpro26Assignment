Flip the Pairs

Task: Please write a program which asks the user to type in a number. The program then prints out all the positive integer values from 1 up to the number. However, the order of the numbers is changed so that each pair or numbers is flipped. That is, 2 comes before 1, 4 before 3 and so forth. See the examples below for details.

Sample Output:
Please type in a number: 5
2
1
4
3
5

Sample Output:
Please type in a number: 6
2
1
4
3
6
5

Instructions:
- Ask for a number
- Print all numbers from 1 to n
- Swap each pair: print 2 before 1, 4 before 3, 6 before 5, etc.
- If n is odd, the last number prints normally
