The Second Occurrence

Task: Please write a program which finds the second occurrence of a substring. If there is no second (or first) occurrence, the program should print out a message accordingly.

In this exercise the occurrences cannot overlap. For example, in the string aaaa the second occurrence of the substring aa is at index 2.

Sample Output:
Please type in a string: abcabc
Please type in a substring: ab
The second occurrence of the substring is at index 3.

Sample Output:
Please type in a string: methodology
Please type in a substring: o
The second occurrence of the substring is at index 6.

Sample Output:
Please type in a string: aybabtu
Please type in a substring: ba
The substring does not occur twice in the string.

Instructions:
- Ask for a string and a substring
- Find the second (non-overlapping) occurrence
- Occurrences cannot overlap (e.g., in "aaaa", 2nd "aa" is at index 2, not 1)
- If found, print: "The second occurrence of the substring is at index [index]."
- If not found twice, print: "The substring does not occur twice in the string."
