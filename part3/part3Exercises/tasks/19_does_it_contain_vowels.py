Does It Contain Vowels

Task: Please write a program which asks the user to input a string. The program then prints out different messages if the string contains any of the vowels a, e or o.

You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. Have a look at the examples below.

Sample Output:
Please type in a string: hello there
a not found
e found
o found

Sample Output:
Please type in a string: hiya
a found
e not found
o not found

Instructions:
- Ask user for a string (assume lowercase)
- Check for vowels a, e, and o separately
- For each vowel, print "[vowel] found" or "[vowel] not found"
- Print in order: a, then e, then o
- Use exact output format as shown
