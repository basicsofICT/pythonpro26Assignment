Powers of Base N

Task: Please change the program from the previous exercise so that the user gets to input also the base which is multiplied (in the previous program the base was always 2).

Sample output:
Upper limit: 27
Base: 3
1
3
9
27


Upper limit: 1234567
Base: 10
1
10
100
1000
10000
100000
1000000

Instructions:
- Start with 1
- Each subsequent number is the previous one multiplied by the base
- Stop when the next number would exceed the limit
- Don't print numbers greater than the limit
- Don't use True as the while loop condition
