Find All the Substrings

Task: Please make an extended version of the previous program, which prints out all the substrings which are at least three characters long, and which begin with the character specified by the user. You may assume the input string is at least three characters long.

Sample Output:
Please type in a word: mammoth
Please type in a character: m
mam
mmo

Sample Output:
Please type in a word: banana
Please type in a character: n

Instructions:
- Ask for a word (at least 3 chars) and a single character
- Find all occurrences of that character
- For each occurrence, print a 3-character substring starting there
- Only print if there are 2 more characters after the match
- Each substring on its own line
