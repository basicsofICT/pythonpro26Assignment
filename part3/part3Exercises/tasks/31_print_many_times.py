Print Many Times

Task: Please write a function named print_many_times(text, times), which takes a string and an integer as arguments. The integer argument specifies how many times the string argument should be printed out:

print_many_times("hi", 5)

print()

text = "All Pythons, except one, grow up"
times = 3
print_many_times(text, times)
Sample output
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi

All Pythons, except one, grow up.
All Pythons, except one, grow up.
All Pythons, except one, grow up.

Instructions:
- Write a function named print_many_times
- It takes two parameters: a string and an integer (amount)
- It prints the string that many times, each on its own line
- The function doesn't return anything
- No need for input() calls
