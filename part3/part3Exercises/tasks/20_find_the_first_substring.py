Find the First Substring

Task: Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string and a single character. The program then prints the first three character slice which begins with the character specified by the user. You may assume the input string is at least three characters long. The program must print out three characters, or else nothing.

Pay special attention to when there are less than two characters left in the string after the first occurrence of the character looked for. In that case nothing should be printed out, and there should not be any indexing errors when executing the program.

Sample Output:
Please type in a word: mammoth
Please type in a character: m
mam

Sample Output::
Please type in a word: banana
Please type in a character: n
nan

Sample Output::
Please type in a word: tomato
Please type in a character: x

Sample Output::
Please type in a word: python
Please type in a character: n

Instructions:
- Ask for a word (at least 3 chars) and a single character
- Find the first occurrence of that character in the word
- Print the 3-character substring starting at that position
- If there aren't 2 more characters after it, print nothing
- If character not found, print nothing
- No indexing errors should occur
