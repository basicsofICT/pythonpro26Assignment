The Sum of Consecutive Numbers, Version 1

Task: Please write a program which asks the user to type in a limit. The program then calculates the sum of consecutive numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ...) until the sum is at least equal to the limit set by the user. The program should function as follows:

Sample Output:
Limit: 2
3

Limit: 10
10

Limit: 18
21

Instructions:
- Ask user for a limit
- Calculate 1 + 2 + 3 + ... until sum >= limit
- Print only the final sum
- The sum might exceed the limit (e.g., limit 18 gives sum 21: 1+2+3+4+5+6)
- You may assume the input is at least 2
