5.3.8 Movie database

Please write a function named add_movie(database: list, name: str, director: str, 
year: int, runtime: int), which adds a new movie to a movie database.

The database is a list, and each movie is represented as a dictionary. The dictionary 
should contain the following keys: name, director, year, runtime.

Example:
    database = []
    add_movie(database, "Gone with the Python", "Victor Pything", 2017, 116)
    add_movie(database, "Pythons on a Plane", "Renny Pytholin", 2001, 94)
    print(database)

Expected output:
    [{"name": "Gone with the Python", "director": "Victor Pything", "year": 2017, "runtime": 116}, 
     {"name": "Pythons on a Plane", "director": "Renny Pytholin", "year": 2001, "runtime": 94}]
