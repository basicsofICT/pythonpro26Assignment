5.3.4 Phone book, version 1

Please write a phone book application. It should work as follows:

    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 2
    name: peter
    number: 040-5466745
    ok!
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 2
    name: emily
    number: 045-1212344
    ok!
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 1
    name: peter
    040-5466745
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 1
    name: mary
    no number
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 2
    name: peter
    number: 09-22223333
    ok!
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 1
    name: peter
    09-22223333
    command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): 3
    quitting...

As you can see, each name can only have one number attached. If a second number is 
added for the same name, it replaces the first number.

Notice! In this exercise you should not print any of the three commands (search, 
add, quit) shown above. Only print the prompt "command (1 search, 2 add, 3 quit): ".
