5.4.3 Older people

Please write a function named older_people(people: list, year: int), which takes 
a list of tuples and an integer as its arguments. Each tuple contains the name and 
birth year of a person.

The function should return the names of all people who were born before the year 
given as an argument.

Example:
    p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
    p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
    p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
    p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
    people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]

    older = older_people(people, 1979)
    print(older)

Expected output:
    ['Adam', 'Mary']
