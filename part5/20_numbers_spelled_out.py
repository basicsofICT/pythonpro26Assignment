5.3.7 Numbers spelled out

Please write a function named dict_of_numbers(), which returns a new dictionary. 
The dictionary should have the numbers 0 to 99 as its keys. The values should be 
the numbers spelled out in English words.

Please note: all the words should start with a lowercase letter.

Example:
    numbers = dict_of_numbers()
    print(numbers[2])
    print(numbers[11])
    print(numbers[45])
    print(numbers[99])
    print(numbers[0])

Expected output:
    two
    eleven
    forty-five
    ninety-nine
    zero
