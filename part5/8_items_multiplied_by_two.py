5.2.1 Items multiplied by two

Please write a function named double_items(numbers: list), which takes a list of 
integers as its argument.

The function should return a new list, which contains all values from the original 
list doubled. The function should not change the original list.

Example:
    numbers = [2, 4, 5, 3, 11, -4]
    numbers_doubled = double_items(numbers)
    print("original:", numbers)
    print("doubled:", numbers_doubled)

Expected output:
    original: [2, 4, 5, 3, 11, -4]
    doubled: [4, 8, 10, 6, 22, -8]
