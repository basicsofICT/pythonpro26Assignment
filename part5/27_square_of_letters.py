5.4.5 Square of letters

In this exercise, you'll implement a function to create a "square of letters" which 
resembles Cartesian coordinates.

Please write a function named square_of_letters(layers: int), which prints out a 
square of letters. The argument determines the number of "layers" or levels.

For example, square_of_letters(3) would print:

    ABCBA
    BCDCB
    CDEDC
    BCDCB
    ABCBA

And square_of_letters(4) would print:

    ABCDCBA
    BCDEFCB
    CDEFEFDC
    DEFGFEFD
    CDEFEFDC
    BCDEFCB
    ABCDCBA

Notice! In this exercise, you should not use any string multiplication. All strings 
should be built character by character using loops.
