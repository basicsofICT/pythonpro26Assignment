5.4.1 Create a tuple

Please write a function named create_tuple(x: int, y: int, z: int), which takes 
three integers as its arguments and creates and returns a tuple based on the following 
criteria:

1. The first element is the smallest of the arguments
2. The second element is the greatest of the arguments
3. The third element is the sum of the arguments

Example:
    print(create_tuple(5, 3, -1))

Expected output:
    (-1, 5, 7)
