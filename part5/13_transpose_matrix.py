5.2.6 Transpose a matrix

Please write a function named transpose(matrix: list), which takes a two-dimensional 
integer array, i.e., a matrix, as its argument. The function should transpose the matrix.

Transposing means essentially flipping the matrix over its diagonal: columns become 
rows, and rows become columns.

The following matrix:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

transposed looks like this:
    1 4 7
    2 5 8
    3 6 9

You may assume the matrix is a square matrix, so it will have an equal number of 
rows and columns.

The function should not have a return value. The matrix should be modified directly 
through the reference.

Example:
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    transpose(matrix)
    print(matrix)

Expected output:
    [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
