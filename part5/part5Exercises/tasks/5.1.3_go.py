5.1.3 Go

In a game of Go two players take turns to place black and white stones on a game board. 
The winner is the player who manages to encircle a bigger area on the board with their 
own game pieces.

Please write a function named who_won(game_board: list), which takes a two-dimensional 
array as its argument. The array consists of integer values, which represent:
    0: empty square
    1: player 1 game piece
    2: player 2 game piece

The function should return the value 1 if player 1 won, and the value 2 if player 2 won. 
If both players have the same number of pieces on the board, the function should return 
the value 0.

Example:
    board = [[1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0]]
    print(who_won(board))
