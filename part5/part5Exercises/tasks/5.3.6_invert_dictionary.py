5.3.6 Invert a dictionary

Please write a function named invert(dictionary: dict), which takes a dictionary 
as its argument. The keys of the dictionary should become the values, and the 
values should become the keys. The dictionary should be modified directly through 
the reference.

Example:
    s = {1: "first", 2: "second", 3: "third", 4: "fourth"}
    invert(s)
    print(s)

Expected output:
    {"first": 1, "second": 2, "third": 3, "fourth": 4}
