5.3.3 Histogram

Please write a function named histogram(string: str), which takes a string as its 
argument. The function should print out a histogram of the letters in the string, 
showing how many times each letter appears.

The letters should be printed in alphabetical order. Each letter should be printed 
on its own line. The number of times the letter appears should be indicated with 
asterisks (*).

Example:
    histogram("abba")

Expected output:
    a **
    b **

Another example:
    histogram("statistically")

Expected output:
    a **
    c *
    i **
    l **
    s **
    t ***
    y *
