5.2.2 Remove the smallest

Please write a function named remove_smallest(numbers: list), which takes a list of 
integers as its argument.

The function should find and remove the smallest item in the list. You may assume 
there is a single smallest item in the list.

The function should not have a return value - it should directly modify the list 
it receives as a parameter.

Example:
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
    remove_smallest(numbers)
    print(numbers)

Expected output:
    [2, 4, 6, 3, 5]
