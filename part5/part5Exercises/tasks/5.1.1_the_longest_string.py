5.1.1 The longest string

Please write a function named longest(strings: list), which takes a list of strings 
as its argument. The function finds and returns the longest string in the list. 
You may assume there is always a single longest string in the list.

Example:
    strings = ["hi", "hiya", "hello", "howdydoody", "hi there"]
    print(longest(strings))

Expected output:
    howdydoody
