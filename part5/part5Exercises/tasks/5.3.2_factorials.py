5.3.2 Factorials

Please write a function named factorials(n: int), which creates and returns a 
dictionary containing factorials. The keys are the numbers 1 to n, and the values 
are the factorials of those numbers.

The factorial of n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive). 
For example, factorial(5) = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120

Example:
    k = factorials(5)
    print(k[1])
    print(k[3])
    print(k[5])

Expected output:
    1
    6
    120
