5.4.2 The oldest person

Please write a function named oldest_person(people: list), which takes a list of 
tuples as its argument. Each tuple contains the name and birth year of a person.

The function should find the oldest person (i.e., the person with the smallest 
birth year) and return their name.

You may assume there is a single oldest person, and that there is at least one 
person in the list.

Example:
    p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
    p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
    p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
    p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
    people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]

    print(oldest_person(people))

Expected output:
    Mary
