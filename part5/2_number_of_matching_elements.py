5.1.2 Number of matching elements

Please write a function named count_matching_elements(my_matrix: list, element: int), 
which takes a two-dimensional array of integers and a single integer value as its arguments. 
The function then counts how many elements within the matrix match the argument value.

Example:
    m = [[1, 2, 1], [0, 3, 4], [1, 0, 0]]
    print(count_matching_elements(m, 1))

Expected output:
    3
