Spell checker

Please write a program which asks the user to type in some text. Your program should then 
perform a spell check, and print out feedback to the user, so that all misspelled words 
have stars around them. Please see the two examples below:

Sample output:
Write text: We use ptython to make a spell checker
We use *ptython* to make a spell checker

Sample output:
Write text: This is acually a good and usefull program
This is *acually* a good and *usefull* program

The case of the letters should be irrelevant to the functioning of your program.

The exercise template includes the file wordlist.txt, which contains all the words the 
spell checker should accept as correct.

NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code 
within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
