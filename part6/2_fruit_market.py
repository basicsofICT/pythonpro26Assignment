Fruit market

The file fruits.csv contains names of fruits, and their prices, in the format specified 
in this example:

banana;6.50
apple;4.95
orange;8.0
...etc...

Please write a function named read_fruits, which reads the file and returns a dictionary 
based on the contents. In the dictionary, the name of the fruit should be the key, and 
the value should be its price. Prices should be of type float.

NB: the function does not take any arguments. The file you are working with is always 
named fruits.csv.

Sample output:
>>> read_fruits()
{'banana': 6.5, 'apple': 4.95, 'orange': 8.0}
