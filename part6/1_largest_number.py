Largest number

Task: The file numbers.txt contains integer numbers, one number per line. The contents could look like this:

2
45
108
3
-10
1100
...etc...

Please write a function named largest, which reads the file and returns the largest number in the file.

Notice that the function does not take any arguments. The file you are working with is always named numbers.txt.

Sample output:
>>> largest()
1100

NB: If Visual Studio Code can't find the file and you have checked that there are no spelling errors, take a look at the instructions following this exercise.
