Matrix


The file matrix.txt contains a matrix in the format specified in the example below:

1,0,2,8,2,1,3,2,5,2,2,2
9,2,4,5,2,4,2,4,1,10,4,2
...etc...

Please write two functions, named matrix_sum and matrix_max. Both go through the matrix 
in the file, and then return the sum of the elements or the element with the greatest 
value, as the names of the functions imply.

Please also write the function row_sums, which returns a list containing the sum of each 
row in the matrix. For example, calling row_sums when the matrix in the file is defined as

1,2,3
2,3,4

the function should return the list [6, 9].

Sample output:
>>> matrix_sum()
56
>>> matrix_max()
10
>>> row_sums()
[6, 9]

Hint: you can also include other helper functions in your program. It is very worthwhile 
to spend a moment considering which functionalities are shared by the three functions you 
are asked to write. Notice that the three functions named above do not take any arguments, 
but any helper functions you write may take arguments. The file you are working with is 
always named matrix.txt.
