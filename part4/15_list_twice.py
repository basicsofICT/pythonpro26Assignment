List twice

Task: Please write a program which asks the user to type in values and adds them to a list. After each addition, the list is printed out in two different ways:

in the order the items were added
ordered from smallest to greatest

The program exits when the user types in 0.

An example of expected behaviour:

Sample output:

New item: 3
The list now: [3]
The list in order: [3]
New item: 1
The list now: [3, 1]
The list in order: [1, 3]
New item: 9
The list now: [3, 1, 9]
The list in order: [1, 3, 9]
New item: 5
The list now: [3, 1, 9, 5]
The list in order: [1, 3, 5, 9]
New item:
Bye!
