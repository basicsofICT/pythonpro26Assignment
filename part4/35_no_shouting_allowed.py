No shouting allowed

Task: Please write a function named no_shouting, which takes a list of strings as an argument. The function returns a new list, with any strings which 'shout' removed. A string shouts if it contains only upper case characters.

You may assume there are no empty strings in the list.

my_list = ["ABC", "def", "UPPER", "ANOTHERUPPER", "lower", "another lower", "Capitalized"]
pruned_list = no_shouting(my_list)
print(pruned_list)

Sample output:
['def', 'lower', 'another lower', 'Capitalized']
