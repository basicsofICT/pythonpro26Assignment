No vowels allowed

Task: Please write a function named no_vowels, which takes a string argument. The function returns a new string, which should be the same as the original but with all vowels removed.

You can assume the string will contain only lower case characters a to z.

my_string = "this is an example"
print(no_vowels(my_string))

Sample output:
ths s n xmpl
