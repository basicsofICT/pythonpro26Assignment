4.5.5 Neighbours in List

Task: Define a function longest_series_of_neighbours(numbers) which returns the length
of the longest contiguous subsequence where neighbouring numbers differ by exactly 1.

Example (when implemented):
print(longest_series_of_neighbours([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])) -> 5

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def longest_series_of_neighbours(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    # Return the length of the longest series of neighbours differing by 1
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the line below
# print(longest_series_of_neighbours([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
