Task: Define a function square(size, character) which prints a size x size square
using the given character (use only the first character of the string).

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def line(length: int, text: str):
    # Print a line of the requested length using the first character of text
    # If text is empty, use '*'
    pass

def square(size: int, character: str):
    # Print a size x size square using the provided character
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the call below
# square(5, "*")
