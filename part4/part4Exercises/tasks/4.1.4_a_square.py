4.1.4 A Square

Task: Define a function square(size, character) which prints a size x size square
using the given character (use only the first character of the string).
Reuse your line() from 4.1.1 or implement a local helper.

Example (when implemented):
square(5, "*") -> prints a 5x5 square of '*'

def line(length: int, text: str):
    # Print a line of the requested length using the first character of text
    # If text is empty, use '*'
    pass

def square(size: int, character: str):
    # Print a size x size square using the provided character
