4.1.10 First, Second, and Last Words

Task: Implement three functions which operate on a sentence (words separated by spaces):
- first_word(sentence) -> returns the first word
- second_word(sentence) -> returns the second word
- last_word(sentence) -> returns the last word

Example (when implemented):
s1 = "it was night"
print(first_word(s1))   # it
print(second_word(s1))  # was
print(last_word(s1))    # night
s2 = "this was tricky"
print(second_word(s2))  # was
s3 = "was indeed"
print(first_word(s3))   # was
"""

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def first_word(sentence: str) -> str:
    # Return the first word in the sentence
    pass

def second_word(sentence: str) -> str:
    # Return the second word in the sentence
    pass

def last_word(sentence: str) -> str:
    # Return the last word in the sentence
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the lines below
# s1 = "it was night"
# print(first_word(s1))
# print(second_word(s1))
# print(last_word(s1))
# s2 = "this was tricky"
# print(second_word(s2))
# s3 = "was indeed"
# print(first_word(s3))
