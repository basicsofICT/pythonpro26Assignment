Addition and removal

Please write a program which asks the user to choose between addition and removal. Depending on the choice, the program adds an item to or removes an item from the end of a list. The item that is added must always be one greater than the last item in the list. The first item to be added must be 1.

The list is printed out in the beginning and after each operation. Have a look at the example execution below:

Sample output
The list is now []
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: d
The list is now [1]
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: d
The list is now [1, 2]
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: d
The list is now [1, 2, 3]
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: r
The list is now [1, 2]
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: d
The list is now [1, 2, 3]
a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it: x
Bye!

You may assume that, if the list is empty, there will not be an attempt to remove items.

NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
