Distinct numbers

Task: Please write a function named distinct_numbers, which takes a list of integers as its argument. The function returns a new list containing the numbers from the original list in order of magnitude, and so that each distinct number is present only once.

my_list = [3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1]
print(distinct_numbers(my_list))

Sample output:
[1, 2, 3]
