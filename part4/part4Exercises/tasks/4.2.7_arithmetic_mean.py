4.2.7 Arithmetic Mean

Task: Define a function mean(lst) which returns the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.

Example (when implemented):
print(mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) -> 3.0
"""

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def mean(lst: list) -> float:
    # Return the arithmetic mean of the values in lst
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the call below
