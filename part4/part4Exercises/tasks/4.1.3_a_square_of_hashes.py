4.1.3 A Square of Hashes

Task: Define a function square_of_hashes(size) which prints a size x size square
made of '#' characters. Reuse your line() from 4.1.1 or implement a local helper.

Example (when implemented):
square_of_hashes(5) -> prints a 5x5 square of '#'

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def line(length: int, text: str):
    # Print a line of the requested length using the first character of text
    # If text is empty, use '*'
    pass

def square_of_hashes(size: int):
    # Print a size x size square made of '#'
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the call below
# square_of_hashes(5)
