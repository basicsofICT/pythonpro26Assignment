"""
4.1.2 A Box of Hashes

Task: Define a function box_of_hashes(height) which prints a box of '#' characters,
10 characters wide and `height` rows tall. Reuse your line() function from 4.1.1.

Example (when implemented):
box_of_hashes(5) -> prints a 10x5 rectangle of '#'
"""

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def line(length: int, text: str):
    # Print a line of the requested length using the first character of text
    # If text is empty, use '*'
    pass

def box_of_hashes(height: int):
    # Print a 10-character wide line of '#' height times
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the call below
# box_of_hashes(5)
