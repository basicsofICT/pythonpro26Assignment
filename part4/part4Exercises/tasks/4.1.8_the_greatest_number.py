4.1.8 The Greatest Number

Task: Define a function greatest(a, b, c) which returns the greatest of three integers.

Example (when implemented):
print(greatest(1, 3, 4)) -> 4
print(greatest(99, 50, 98)) -> 99
print(greatest(-10, 0, -30)) -> 0
"""

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def greatest(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Return the greatest of the three arguments
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the calls below
# print(greatest(1, 3, 4))
# print(greatest(99, 50, 98))
# print(greatest(-10, 0, -30))
