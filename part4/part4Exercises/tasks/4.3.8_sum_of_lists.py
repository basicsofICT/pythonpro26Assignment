4.3.8 Sum of Lists

Task: Define a function sum_of_lists(a, b) which returns a new list where each element
is the sum of the corresponding elements in lists a and b.

Example (when implemented):
print(sum_of_lists([1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9])) -> [8, 10, 12]

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def sum_of_lists(a: list, b: list) -> list:
    # Return element-wise sum of a and b
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the call below
# print(sum_of_lists([1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9]))
