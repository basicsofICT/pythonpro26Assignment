Task: Define a function shortest(words) which returns the shortest string in the list.

Example (when implemented):
print(shortest(["first", "second", "third"])) -> first
print(shortest(["tim", "dorothy"])) -> tim

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def shortest(words: list[str]) -> str:
    # Return the shortest string
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the lines below
# print(shortest(["first", "second", "third"]))
# print(shortest(["tim", "dorothy"]))
