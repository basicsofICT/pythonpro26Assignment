4.1.1 Line

Task: Define a function line(length, text) which prints a line of length `length` using
the first character of `text`. If `text` is empty, use '*'.

Examples (when implemented and called):
line(7, "%") -> prints %%%%%%%
line(10, "LOL") -> prints LLLLLLLLLL
line(3, "") -> prints ***

# TODO: Implement your solution below this line
def line(length: int, text: str):
    # Print a line of the requested length using the first character of text
    # If text is empty, use '*'
    pass

# You can test locally by uncommenting the calls below
# line(7, "%")
# line(10, "LOL")
# line(3, "")
