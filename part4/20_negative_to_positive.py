From Negative to positive

Please write a program which asks the user for a positive integer N. The program then prints out all numbers between -N and N inclusive, but leaves out the number 0. Each number should be printed on a separate line.

An example of expected behaviour:

Sample output
Please type in a positive integer: 4
-4
-3
-2
-1
1
2
3
4

NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
