Everything reversed

Task: Please write a function named everything_reversed, which takes a list of strings as its argument. The function returns a new list with all strings in the original list reversed. Also, the order of the items should be reversed in the new list.

my_list = ["Hi", "there", "example", "one more"]
new_list = everything_reversed(my_list)
print(new_list)

Sample output:
['erom eno', 'elpmaxe', 'ereht', 'iH']
