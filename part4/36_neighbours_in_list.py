Neighbours in a list

Task: Please write a function named longest_series_of_neighbours, which takes a list of integers as an argument. The function should return the length of the longest series of numbers in the list, where two consecutive numbers differ by exactly 1.

For example, in the list [1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 4] the longest such series would be [5, 4, 3, 4], with a length of 4.

my_list = [1, 2, 5, 7, 6, 5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 0]
print(longest_series_of_neighbours(my_list))

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13]
print(longest_series_of_neighbours(my_list))

Sample output:
4
4
