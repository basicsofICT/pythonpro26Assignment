Formatted

Task: Please write a function named formatted, which takes a list of floating point numbers as its argument. The function returns a new list, which contains each element of the original list in string format, rounded to two decimal places.

An example of the function in action:

my_list = [1.234, 0.3333, 0.11111, 3.446]
new_list = formatted(my_list)
print(new_list)

Sample output:
['1.23', '0.33', '0.11', '3.45']
