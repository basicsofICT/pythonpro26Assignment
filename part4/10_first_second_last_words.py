First, second and last words

Task: Please write three functions: first_word, second_word and last_word. Each function takes a string argument.

As their names imply, the functions return the first, second and last word in the sentence they receive as their argument.

In each case you may assume the argument string contains at least two separate words, and all words are separated by exactly one space character.

sentence = "it was a dark and stormy night"
print(first_word(sentence)) # it
print(second_word(sentence)) # was
print(last_word(sentence)) # night

second_sentence = "it was"
print(second_word(second_sentence)) # was
print(last_word(second_sentence)) # was

Sample output:
it
was
night
was
was
