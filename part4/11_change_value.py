Change the value of an item

Task: Please write a program which initialises a list with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then the program should ask the user for an index and a new value, replace the value at the given index, and print the list again. This should be looped over until the user gives -1 for the index. You can assume all given index values will fall within your list.

An example execution of the program:

Sample output

Index: 0
New value: 10
[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Index: 2
New value: 250
[10, 2, 250, 4, 5]
Index: 4
New value: -45
[10, 2, 250, 4, -45]
Index: -1

NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
